            <p> Auguta Ada King. Countess of Lovelace was an Enlish mathematicians
                and writer, known for her work on charles Babbage's proposed machanical general-purposed computer,
                the Analytical Engine. She has been called as the world's first
                computer programmer. What she did was write the world's first machine algorithm
                for an early computing machine that existed only on paper.</p>
